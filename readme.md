# VASL setup files

This repository contains VASL setup files including custom playaids for the scenarios. The playaids are also stored in HTML, serving as templates for new playaid designs.

Setup files and playaids are organized by vendor / source.

You will need the complete set of maps for VASL to make these setups work. These can be found here:
